## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to ensure your system has the necessary tools. These steps will guide you through checking for and installing them for both macOS and Windows.

### Step 1: Install a Package Manager

A package manager automates the process of installing, updating, and removing software.

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS (Homebrew)</strong></summary>

*   **To check if you have Homebrew installed**, open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    brew --version
    ```
*   **If it's installed**, you will see a version number (e.g., `Homebrew 3.6.12`). You can proceed to the next step.
*   **If you get an error** like `command not found: brew`, you need to install it. Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows (Winget)</strong></summary>

*   **To check if you have Winget installed**, open PowerShell and run:
    ```powershell
    winget --version
    ```
*   **If it's installed**, you will see a version number (e.g., `v1.3.2091`). You can proceed to the next step.
*   **If you get an error**, Winget is included by default in modern versions of Windows. You can install or update it from the Microsoft Store by searching for **"App Installer"**.

</details>

### Step 2: Install Python

This project is built with Python and requires it to run.

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>

*   **To check if you have Python installed**, run:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
*   **If it's installed**, you will see a version number (e.g., `Python 3.9.7`).
*   **If you get an error**, you can install Python using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

*   **To check if you have Python installed**, open PowerShell and run:
    ```powershell
    python --version
    ```
*   **If it's installed**, you will see a version number (e.g., `Python 3.9.7`).
*   **If you get an error**, you can install Python using Winget:
    ```powershell
    winget install Python.Python.3
    ```

</details>

### Step 3: Check for pip (Python Package Installer)

`pip` is Python's own package manager, used to install the project's dependencies. It typically comes included with Python.

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>

*   **To check if you have pip installed**, run:
    ```bash
    pip3 --version
    ```
*   **If it's installed**, you will see output like `pip 21.3.1 from ...`.
*   **If you get an error**, it's likely your Python installation is incomplete. Try reinstalling Python (Step 2) or run `python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

*   **To check if you have pip installed**, run:
    ```powershell
    pip --version
    ```
*   **If it's installed**, you will see output like `pip 21.3.1 from ...`.
*   **If you get an error**, it's likely your Python installation is incomplete. Try reinstalling Python (Step 2) or run `python -m ensurepip --upgrade`.

</details>

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Once the prerequisites are met, you can install the project itself.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gautamchaskar/NSE-Stock-Data
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd NSE-Stock-Data
    ```
3.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    *   On **macOS**, run:
        ```bash
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   On **Windows**, run:
        ```powershell
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Pipeline (L1-L2-L3)

This project is structured as a three-level data pipeline. Each level has a dedicated script and data folder, making the workflow clear and modular.

| Level | Script | Input Folder | Output Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L1** | `L1_fetch_historical_data.py` | (None) | `L1_historical_stock_data/` | Fetches raw historical stock data from yfinance. |
| **L2** | `L2_run_seasonal_analysis.py` | `L1_historical_stock_data/` | `L2_seasonal_analysis_reports/` | Runs an exhaustive seasonal analysis on each stock. |
| **L3** | `L3_generate_insights.py` | `L2_seasonal_analysis_reports/` | `L3_actionable_insights/` | Filters and ranks the L2 data to find actionable insights. |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Pipeline

Run the scripts in order from your terminal.

> **Note:** The L2 analysis is the most computationally intensive step and may take a significant amount of time to complete for all stocks.

### Step 1: Fetch Raw Data (L1)
```bash
python L1_fetch_historical_data.py
```

### Step 2: Run Seasonal Analysis (L2)
```bash
python -u L2_run_seasonal_analysis.py
```

### Step 3: Generate Actionable Insights (L3)
```bash
python L3_generate_insights.py
```

## üß† Analysis Deep Dive

This section provides a conceptual overview of the logic used in the L2 and L3 scripts.

### Level 2: The Calculation

To find the best seasonal periods, the tool performs an exhaustive, three-level analysis by testing every possible time window (from 1 to 365 days) at every possible starting point within the year.

#### Evaluating a "Slot"
A "slot" is the combination of a time window (e.g., 30 days) and a starting point (e.g., March 1st). Each slot is evaluated by looking at its historical performance across all available years.

1.  **Gathering Yearly Returns:** It finds the return for that slot for every single year in the dataset.
2.  **Finding the "Typical" Return (Median):** It calculates the **median return** from the list of yearly returns to get a realistic picture of the slot's typical performance.
3.  **Measuring Consistency:** It calculates the percentage of years where the return was **greater than 0%**.

The final output for each slot includes metrics like `median_return`, `consistency`, `min_return`, `max_return`, `Standard_Dev`, and `total_years`. This entire list of over 130,000 evaluated slots is saved to a CSV file for each stock in the `L2_seasonal_analysis_reports/` folder.

### Level 3: Actionable Insights Strategy

The L3 script filters the 130,000+ slots from the L2 analysis to find the single "best" opportunity for each stock using a two-stage process.

#### Stage 1: Minimum Quality Filter
A slot must meet all of the following strict criteria to be considered:
- **Consistency:** `> 80%`
- **Data History:** `>= 2 years`
- **Minimum Return:** `>= +15%` (The worst performance was still a 15% gain)
- **Slot Time:** `3 to 15 days`

#### Stage 2: The Quality Score
Any slot that passes the filter is then ranked using a weighted **Quality Score** to balance safety, return, and risk:

`Quality Score = (Consistency * 50%) + (Median Return * 30%) + (Risk-Adjusted Return * 20%)`

Where `Risk-Adjusted Return` is calculated as `Median Return / Standard Deviation`. The opportunity with the highest final Quality Score for each stock is saved to `L3_actionable_insights/actionable_insights.csv`.
